# Technology

Developed using Python Flask, and a lot of CSS and Jinja2.
Currently hosted on Github. 

Sidenote: This is a living, breathing project, as I continue devloping and broadening my skillset, my website will reflect accordingly. I am new to web development so my first few iterations will require much improvement.
